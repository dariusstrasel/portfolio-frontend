                                    and sent a link for the finished photos within a week of our event. In addition to his stunning and thoughtful photos, Darius is kind, intelligent, and willing to jump in to ensure your event is a success. He takes
                                    direction well and thrives on feedback. I would recommend Darius not only for his many talents, but for the passion and integrity he brings to everything he does.</blockquote>

                                    interest as well.) The fearless part of Darius is how he is not afraid to ask questions and share his knowledge with the community every single day undeterred. He would be a great employee for any industry! He will

                                    building a Chrome Extension to fit to modify our teams' software, but didn't have the technical skills to do it myself. Darius offered to help quickly rewrote a lot of the code to be understandable for non-engineers.
                                    Now I can customize our product management software just by adding few strings to the extension. I'm so grateful to have found Darius on Simbi. I highly suggest you reach out to him if you're having any issues with
                                    your code. He's very kind and communicative. You won't regret it!</blockquote>

                                    demonstrated to me an incredible grasp of complex thinking, programming, database and development concepts that I believe would make him successful... I cannot recommend him enough as an extraordinarily bright, kind
